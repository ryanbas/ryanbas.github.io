            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>This is the beginning. This is going to be an adventure.</p>
            <p>I'm creating this blog to become better. My main goal is to become a better developer but I hope I become better in other ways during this journey. Some inspiration for this project comes from a blog called <a href="http://sixsixfive.com">665</a> that I read growing up. His only goal was to write 665 entries and it didn't matter what they were about.</p>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a software developer located in Toronto, Ontario. I attended the University of Waterloo as a computer science major in the co-op program from 2005 - 2010. I grew up with computers and the first time I used one I knew the only thing in life I was going to be is a developer. Even now I can't imagine an occupation I'd enjoy more than being a developer. The language I've focused on most of my career is Java but I have been writing Scala code for the last couple years.</p>
            <h2>The Blog</h2>
            <p>This blog is going to be an assortment of writing about things I learn about or enjoy. I'm going to use it to learn new things and to write about them. My current motivation for starting this is to understand functional programming better and write a purely functional blogging framework in Scala. I'm going to try to either improve something about my blog, or show off something new I've learned no matter how small. I want to try to make this a daily thing but I'm terrible when it comes to sticking to a schedule so no promises there.</p>
            <p>I'm also going to try writing as much code as I can from scratch. I'm not sure what kind of restrictions I'll put on myself but as long as I enjoy coding it I'll code it. For example, I don't see myself writing my own database engine but having to refresh my browser after every change makes me want to write a plugin to refresh it automatically.</p>
            <p>I'm sure a tool exists for everything I'm setting out to accomplish but I'm going to avoid using them. This project is more about learning and failing on my own. I'm sure there will be mistakes and missteps. Right now this is an index.html page I'm editing in VS Code and putting in my <a href="https://github.com/ryanbas/ryanbas.github.io">GitHub Pages</a> repo to publish entries. I used Chrome's console to do `new Date()` and pasted the time in the entry title after I decided I was done editing and made my final save. This is as basic as it gets. My own domain, styling, a framework, continuous integration and deployment, and more will come with time. I'm not sure where I'm going or how I'll get there but I plan to take it one day at a time.</p>
