            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>I was inspired by a recent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> post about a single binary website because that was my original goal with this website. The post and discussion can be found <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31081049">here</a> but that story also linked to more interesting website <a href="https://j3s.sh/thought/my-website-is-one-binary.html">https://j3s.sh/</a> which I thought gave a compelling argument for creating a single binary dynamic website.</p>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>My original idea for this site was to write it in Scala and create a custom web framework using all the functional programming knowledge I had. I could never motivate myself to start it though and even from the beginning I was procrastinating when it came to writing it. I started by writing a <a href="/blog/entries/002.html">Chrome extension</a> to hot-reload my page and doing some organization stuff. Then some messing around with handlebars and templates and getting frustrated trying to learn node.js.</p>
            <p>There's a bunch of points that resonated with me from the <a href="https://j3s.sh/thought/my-website-is-one-binary.html">j3s.sh blog post</a> about creating a single binary dynamic website:
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintainable - Not pulling in a bunch of dependencies and running code that you have no idea what its doing</li>
                    <li>Minimalistic - Writing raw html for everything is pretty painful without any extra tools so every page and template are bound to be simple</li>
                    <li>Dynamic - You can write one off functions to create different "apps" or functionality (the blogpost example being getting the user's IP address)</li>
                    <li>Language - Everything will be written in Rust and I can focus on learning that</li>
                    <li>Deployment - It's a shell script that builds, copies, and starts a binary</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>I changed my site from being generated statically from handlebars templates to being served by a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"">Rust</a> binary because I've been trying to learn Rust for a few weeks. It was really simple to do the way I had things setup. I have been reading through the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust book</a> and at the end it leads you through the exercise of writing a simple webserver. I followed that guide and created a version that can serve my index page, blog entries, and a 404 page.</p>
            <p>I'm trying to write the webserver in a test-driven way and have a samll idea of how I want things to work. My site is still running of github pages until I buy myself a domain and server to host this binary. I want there to be a sitemap page which lists all pages on my site. That page should be dynamically generated by walking the tree of my project. For now that will be everything in the <code>blog</code> folder. I also want a raw directory and file viewer similar to <code>j3s.sh</code> (<a href="https://git.j3s.sh/j3s.sh/tree/main/review">directories</a> and <a href="https://git.j3s.sh/j3s.sh/tree/main/main.go">files</a>).</p>
