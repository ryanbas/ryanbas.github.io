            <h2>Cleanup</h2>
            <p>I've been cleaning up my Rust code and creating structs for things like the <code>Request</code>, <code>Response</code>, and <code>Endpoint</code>. I've also been removing duplicate code and strings and trying to make the code clearer. Next I need to start looking into getting a domain and server so I can actually host my website instead of relying on github pages.</p>
            <p>If anyone has experience with server hosting or VPS companies feel free to contact me through <a href="https://keybase.io/ryanbas">keybase</a>. I'm looking for a Canadian company ideally and don't even know the specs I need or a reasonable cost.</p>
            <p>Speaking of keybase, I added <a href="/keybase.txt">my proof</a> that I own this site. Which is kind of obvious because I own the github account it's on. When I get my domain I will have to put the proof there as well. I really just wanted to test that it worked.</p>
